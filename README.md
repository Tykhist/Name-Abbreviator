# Name-Abbreviator
Simple python program that abbreviates names.
Works best with up to one middle name, afterward it will only print the last name. 
Only recognizes white space separation, so hyphens are okay. 
Could potentially be improved to abbreviate all parts of a name up to the last name, but that could get very ridiculous very quickly.
